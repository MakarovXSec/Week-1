# Week-1
# Week 1 – Secure Environment and Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## 📌 Objective
To establish a controlled, private, and secure environment for learning cybersecurity, always within ethical and legal boundaries.

---

## 🔐 Secure Environment Setup

### ✅ Operational Identity
- Created a separate digital alias to keep practical work isolated from personal identity.
- Set up secure accounts (ProtonMail, Telegram, GitHub) with no link to personal data.

### ✅ Private Browsing
- Installed and configured the **Tor Browser**.
- Enabled bridges to bypass censorship and enhance anonymity.
- Verified Tor functionality inside the virtual machine.

### ✅ Virtualized Environment
- Installed **Kali Linux** in **VirtualBox**.
- Configured network and graphical environment.
- Created **snapshots** to preserve a clean and restorable setup.
- Successfully launched Tor within the virtual environment.

## ⚖️ Ethics and Legality in Cybersecurity

### ❗ Boundaries That Must Never Be Crossed:
- **Never access systems** without explicit permission.
- **Never collect personal data** for harmful purposes.
- **Never perform real-world tests** on infrastructure without proper authorization.
- **Never share tools or knowledge** with malicious intent.

### 🧠 Reflection
> Ethical hacking requires responsibility. Research is not a crime, but legality, intention, and context always matter.

## 🗂️ Organization

- Maintained a structured project folder under the alias identity.
- All configurations are documented for reproducibility, while protecting privacy.

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways

- Importance of digital isolation for safe learning and experimentation.
- Setup of anonymous environments respecting user privacy.
- Basic understanding of European cybercrime laws and digital responsibility.
- Acknowledgement that **ethics are the foundation** of all cybersecurity practices.

## 🧠 Next Step: OSINT
From this secure environment, the next stage involves controlled practice of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques, always respecting legal and ethical standards.
